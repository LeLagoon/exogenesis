This is a simulation website of an hybrid event hosted for students to participate and win. It includes various features like user registration, school registration and so on. It is a portal where they are able to create teams, manage teams and their profiles. They have everything lined up for them and everything is accessible through the portal. I created this while specifically keeping UI and UX in my mind. I wanted to make it easy to use with lots of functionalities.
